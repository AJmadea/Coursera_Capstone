These cities do have a large hispanic population so this is not a huge surprise.  Cuban Restaurant is the second most common venue for some zipcodes in cluster 0.  \n    \n    The sole-proprietorships clusters 3 and 4 are unique.  Cluster 4 has 07306 of Jersey City with its distinction from the most common venue: Indian Restaurant.  The Indian Restaurant frequency was about one quarter in this zipcode.  This was probably the most determinging factor about cluster 4.\n    \n    Cluster 3's solo member is less of an outlier as the most common venue is Deli/Bodega.  The algorithm might have assigned it uniquely to cluster 3, because it has unique 2nd common venue: a Dance Studio.\n    \n    Cluster 2 is the most puzzling.  There is no clear distinction on why these zipcodes were placed in cluster 2; however, there is some similarity between all of these zipcodes.  They typically include general venues like Banks, Bar, and a few Restaurants."

These labels were inserted into a KMeans algorithm were the zipcodes were clusterd according to common venues.  One zipcode was identified with a large frequency of indian restaurants.  One zipcode had an unsually high number of dance studios.  Many zipcodes had high number of Italian restaurants.  There are alot of Latin American Restaurants in the northern parts of Hudson county.
